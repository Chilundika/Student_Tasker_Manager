## Key Features
1. **Task Management**: Students can track and update their tasks and subjects.
2. **Subject Management**: Organizes and manages subjects, ensuring all relevant information is easily accessible.
3. **Task Status Tracking**: Provides visual representations of task progress using charts and graphs.
4. **User Roles and Portals**:
   - **Students**: Can manage their tasks, track progress, and view assignments.
   - **Admins**: Can manage student accounts and oversee the overall system.

## Problems Addressed
1. **Disorganization**: Centralizes task and subject management to reduce confusion and ensure all relevant information is in one place.
2. **Missed Deadlines**: Helps students keep track of their tasks and deadlines to improve timely submission.
3. **Inefficient Communication**: Facilitates better tracking and updates regarding task progress.
4. **Data Fragmentation**: Ensures all task-related data is stored in one centralized location.
5. **Lack of Accountability**: Enables tracking of task completion and provides insights into student progress.
6. **Resource Inefficiency**: Streamlines task management, saving time and improving efficiency for students and administrators.

## Future Enhancements
For now, the project will focus solely on the student and administrator functionalities, with the lectures/teachers aspect being removed until further notice. This ensures a streamlined approach to developing and refining the core features aimed at enhancing student task management and progress tracking.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

1. **PHP**: For server-side scripting and handling the backend logic.
   
3. **MySQL**: As the database to store and manage data related to students, tasks, progress, and assignments.
   
5. **JavaScript**: For client-side scripting and creating dynamic and interactive elements on the web pages.
   
7. **Chart.js**: A JavaScript library used for creating interactive charts and visualizations to represent student progress and other data.
   
9. **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
    
11. **CSS**: For styling the web pages and ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface.
    
13. **XAMPP**: An easy-to-install Apache distribution containing PHP, MySQL, and Perl, used as a local server environment for development and testing.
    

These technologies work together to create a comprehensive web-based application that helps students, teachers, and administrators manage tasks and assignments efficiently.
