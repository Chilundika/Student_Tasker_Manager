# StudentTasker: Progress Manager

## Project Overview
StudentTasker: Progress Manager is a web-based application designed to help students and administrators manage tasks and assignments efficiently. It centralizes task management, subject tracking, and progress monitoring, making it easier for students to stay organized and for administrators to oversee student progress.

## Key Features
1. **Task Management**: Students can track and update their tasks and subjects.
2. **Subject Management**: Organizes and manages subjects, ensuring all relevant information is easily accessible.
3. **Task Status Tracking**: Provides visual representations of task progress using charts and graphs.
4. **User Roles and Portals**:
   - **Students**: Can manage their tasks, track progress, and view assignments.
   - **Admins**: Can manage student accounts and oversee the overall system.

## Problems Addressed
1. **Disorganization**: Centralizes task and subject management to reduce confusion and ensure all relevant information is in one place.
2. **Missed Deadlines**: Helps students keep track of their tasks and deadlines to improve timely submission.
3. **Inefficient Communication**: Facilitates better tracking and updates regarding task progress.
4. **Data Fragmentation**: Ensures all task-related data is stored in one centralized location.
5. **Lack of Accountability**: Enables tracking of task completion and provides insights into student progress.
6. **Resource Inefficiency**: Streamlines task management, saving time and improving efficiency for students and administrators.

## Future Enhancements
For now, the project will focus solely on the student and administrator functionalities, with the lectures/teachers aspect being removed until further notice. This ensures a streamlined approach to developing and refining the core features aimed at enhancing student task management and progress tracking.
